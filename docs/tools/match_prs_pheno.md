# qpgentools match-prs-pheno

## Summary 

`qpgentools match-prs-pheno` matches samples between PRS (Polygenic Risk Score) and phenotype matrices. It is typically used for sample identity verification or to detect sample swaps by correlating genetically predicted risks (PRS) with observed phenotypes across multiple traits. The tool identifies the best matching PRS profile for each phenotype sample.

A detailed description of the framework, the scores, the automatic shrinkage and the treatment of missing values is given on the [methods page](match_prs_pheno_methods.md).

A typical running example command is given below:

```bash
qpgentools match-prs-pheno --prs [prs_matrix] --pheno [pheno_matrix] --out [out_prefix]
```

## Required options

* `--prs` : Input PRS matrix file. The file should contain PRS values for multiple traits across samples.
* `--pheno` : Input phenotype matrix file. The file should contain observed phenotype values for the corresponding traits.
* `--out` : Output prefix to store the matching results.

## Additional Options

* `--cov` : Input covariate matrix file (optional). If provided, phenotypes will be adjusted for covariates before matching.
* `--sample-tsv` : TSV file containing sample ID mapping between PRS and phenotype files. Format: `[PRS_SAMPLE_ID] [PHENO_SAMPLE_ID]`. 
* `--trait-tsv` : TSV file containing trait ID mapping between PRS and phenotype files. Format: `[PRS_TRAIT_ID] [PHENO_TRAIT_ID]`.
* `--weights` : Input weights file for each phenotype. Format: `[PHENO_ID] [WEIGHT]`. If not provided, weights are estimated based on the correlation between PRS and phenotype in overlapping samples.
* `--prs-format` : Format of the PRS file (default: 'regenie'). Options: 'regenie', 'tsv-sample-col', 'tsv-sample-row'.
* `--pheno-format` : Format of the phenotype file (default: 'regenie'). Options: 'regenie', 'tensorqtl', 'tsv-sample-col', 'tsv-sample-row'.
* `--cov-format` : Format of the covariate file (default: 'regenie'). Options: 'regenie', 'tsv-sample-col', 'tsv-sample-row'.
* `--missing-str` : Comma-separated strings that represent missing values in the phenotype and covariate matrices (default: `NA`). The PRS matrix must not contain missing values; the program stops with an error if it does.
* `--missing-as-mean` : Impute missing phenotype values with the mean of the observed values of that trait and treat them as observed from then on (default: false). See [Handling missing values](#handling-missing-values).
* `--missing-as-min` : Impute missing phenotype values with the minimum of the observed values of that trait and treat them as observed, appropriate when missing means below a detection limit (default: false). Cannot be combined with `--missing-as-mean`.
* `--cov-impute-mean` : When covariates contain missing values, mean-impute them (using the mean of observed samples per covariate) instead of dropping samples with any missing covariate (default: false). See [Handling missing values](#handling-missing-values).
* `--rint` : Perform rank-based inverse normal transformation on phenotypes after covariate adjustment (default: false).
* `--mahalanobis` : Account for correlations between traits by whitening the profiles with a shrunk covariance matrix before computing the cosine similarity (default: false). With `--lambda 1` this is identical to the default independence score, computed by a slower route.
* `--weight-prs-mh` : Weight given to the PRS covariance when the PRS and phenotype covariances are blended into the Mahalanobis metric, as `w * COV_prs + (1 - w) * COV_pheno` (default: 0.5). Only used with `--mahalanobis`.
* `--lambda` : Fixed shrinkage parameter for the Mahalanobis covariance, applied as `(1 - lambda) * COV + lambda * I`. Must be between 0 and 1 (default: 0.0, i.e. no shrinkage). Values around 0.3 to 0.6 typically perform far better than 0 or 1; see `--auto-lambda`. Only used with `--mahalanobis`.
* `--no-norm` : Use the legacy independence score, the weighted inner product divided by the total absolute weight of the observed traits, instead of the weighted cosine similarity (default: false). Not applicable with `--mahalanobis`. See the [methods page](match_prs_pheno_methods.md#21-without-mahalanobis-weighted-cosine-similarity).
* `--exact-norm` : When phenotypes have missing values, compute each PRS norm over the traits observed for the phenotyped sample instead of over all traits (default: false). Without `--mahalanobis`, or with `--lambda 1`, this costs one extra matrix product; with other lambda values it costs one pass per distinct missingness pattern.
* `--min-weight` : Minimum weight (correlation) per trait to include in the analysis; traits below this are given zero weight (default: 0.0).
* `--z-threshold` : Z-score threshold for declaring a lenient match (default: 1.96).
* `--z-diff` : Z-score difference between the best and second-best match to declare a clear match (default: 2.0).
* `--threads` : Number of threads used by Eigen for the matrix operations (default: 1).

## Auto-lambda options

These options apply with `--mahalanobis` and control the automatic choice of the shrinkage parameter.

* `--auto-lambda` : Choose the Mahalanobis shrinkage parameter automatically (default: false). The phenotyped samples with a mapped PRS sample are scored against all PRS samples for candidate values of lambda, and the value maximizing the separation of the self match is selected by golden-section search over 0 to 1. Requires `--lambda 0` (the default) and a sample mapping or shared sample IDs. Costs roughly ten scoring passes. Only used with `--mahalanobis`.
* `--auto-lambda-metric` : Criterion maximized by `--auto-lambda` (default: `mean-log-softmax`, the mean log-probability of the self match under a softmax over the Z-scores of all candidates). Alternatives: `mean-z` (mean self Z-score) and `mrr` (mean reciprocal rank of the self match).
* `--auto-lambda-min-self` : Minimum number of phenotyped samples with a mapped PRS sample and at least one observed trait required for tuning (default: 100). Fewer is an error, since the criterion would be too noisy; check the sample mapping, set `--lambda` manually, or lower the threshold.
* `--auto-lambda-min-best` : Minimum number of mapped samples whose own PRS sample ranks first at the tuned lambda (default: 100; 0 disables the check). Fewer is an error. It usually indicates a mismatched sample mapping, for example completely mismatched IDs, which also invalidates the trait weights estimated from the same mapping. The log reports the self-best count and fraction at the tuned lambda.

## Handling missing values

Missing phenotype values (strings listed in `--missing-str`, `NA` by default) are ignored by default rather than imputed. Two alternatives impute them before any other processing and then treat them as observed: `--missing-as-mean` fills each missing cell with the trait's observed mean, and `--missing-as-min` fills it with the trait's observed minimum, which is appropriate when a missing measurement indicates a value below the detection limit. With imputation, `N.Traits` counts all traits with non-zero weight. Under the default, concretely:

* Each trait is standardized using the mean and standard deviation of its observed values only. Missing cells contribute nothing to any downstream inner product.
* Per-trait weights (`Weight` in the weights file) are estimated from the matched samples in which the phenotype is observed; `N.Obs` reports that count.
* For each phenotyped sample, the score is computed over its observed traits only. `N.Traits` reports the number of observed traits with non-zero weight.
* The score is a weighted cosine similarity in both modes. Its numerator and the phenotype norm run over the observed traits only. The PRS norm is computed over all traits by default; `--exact-norm` restricts it to the observed traits of each phenotyped sample. With `--mahalanobis`, the trait covariance is estimated from the standardized matrix with missing cells at zero (mean imputation), and the cross term is restricted to the observed traits on both sides.
* With `--cov`, traits with missing values are adjusted by regressing on the covariates using only their observed samples. Traits without missing values are adjusted together in a single batch.
* With `--rint`, the rank-based inverse normal transformation is applied to the observed values of each trait.
* A phenotyped sample with no observed trait of non-zero weight is reported with `MatchStatus` `NO_OBS_TRAITS`, `N.Traits` 0 and `NA` in all numeric columns.

Missing covariate values are handled by dropping every sample with at least one missing covariate from the phenotype matrix before adjustment. The number of dropped samples is reported in the log, and these samples do not appear in the output. Use `--cov-impute-mean` to keep them with mean-imputed covariates instead.

The PRS matrix is assumed to be complete. If it contains a value matching `--missing-str`, the program stops with an error.

There is currently no minimum number of observed samples per trait or observed traits per sample; adding such thresholds is planned.

## Expected Output

The following files are expected to be generated:

* `[out_prefix].weights.tsv.gz` : (If `--weights` is not provided) Calculated weights for each trait.
    * Columns: `Trait`, `Weight`, `N.Obs` (number of matched samples with observed phenotype used to estimate the weight)
* `[out_prefix].match.assigned.tsv.gz` : Summary of the best match for each phenotype sample.
    * Columns:
        * `ID.Pheno`: Sample ID in the phenotype file.
        * `N.Traits`: Number of observed traits with non-zero weight used for this sample.
        * `MatchStatus`: Status of the match (e.g., `BEST_MATCH`, `NO_MATCH`, `LENIENT_MATCH`, or `NO_OBS_TRAITS` when no trait is observed).
        * `ID.self`: Corresponding sample ID in the PRS file (based on mapping or ID match).
        * `Z.self`: Z-score of the match with itself.
        * `COR.self`: Weighted correlation with itself.
        * `Rank.self`: Rank of the self-match among all PRS samples.
* `[out_prefix].match.all.tsv.gz` : Detailed output including the top 5 matches for each phenotype sample.
    * Columns: `ID.Pheno`, `N.Traits`, `MatchStatus`, `ID.self`, `Z.self`, `COR.self`, `Rank.self`, followed by `ID.1st`, `Z.1st`, `COR.1st` through `ID.5th`, `Z.5th`, `COR.5th` for the five best-matching PRS samples.
    * `MatchStatus` in this file is one of `SELF_BEST` (the mapped PRS sample ranks first), `SELF_LENIENT` (it does not rank first but its Z-score exceeds `--z-threshold`), `SINGLE_NEW_BEST` (the best match leads the second by more than `--z-diff`), `MULTI_NEW_BEST` (a clear gap appears further down the top five), `UNCLEAR`, `NO_SELF` (no mapped PRS sample and no clear new best), or `NO_OBS_TRAITS`. Phenotype samples without a mapped PRS sample (`ID.self` = `NA`) receive `NO_SELF`, or `SINGLE_NEW_BEST` / `MULTI_NEW_BEST` when the top matches are clearly separated, or `NO_OBS_TRAITS`.
